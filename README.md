# Squat Tracker 

Oh hello there!  
Welcome to my second app! I created this project from scratch with the goal to learn while I build.  

**Started:** Feb 2023
<br>**Completion:** March 2023

**Here's What I Learned: **
</br> ✅ CoreData and UserDefault for data management 
</br> ✅ Introduction to Protocol / Delegates 
</br> ✅ UserNotification / Push Notifications Framework 
</br> ✅ Date & DateComponents
</br> ✅ BarChartKit - 3rd Party Library 
</br> ✅ ConfettiView - 3rd Party Library 
</br> ✅ HorizonCalendar - Airbnb 3rd Party Library 

**Here Are Skills I Perfected A Little Bit More** 
</br> ✅ UIKit 
</br> ✅ Auto layout
</br> ✅ StackView
</br> ✅ Familiarization, repetition, application of classes/struts
</br> ✅ MVC design architecture - *Practice makes perfect! I definitely am getting better with this!*


**Final Thoughts** 
</br>When I first started working on this project I didn't realize how challenging it was to work with push notifications and Dates. Originally, I was able to knock out the UI for the different view relatively easily since I had practice learning UIKit from my first app (Parker Plays).  With the improved and quick progress I made I thought that I'd be able to knock out Squat Tracker fairly quickly.   

Boy, was I wrong! This was far more challenging logistically than I had imaged.  There were so many different edge cases that I needed to go through. Authorization didn't cross my mind when I decided to build this app. On the surface level this app appears simple, but the backend portion of things taught me very valuable lessons. 

Still a firm believer in learning by building, so, on to the next app!
